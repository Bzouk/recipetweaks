[h1] Recipe tweaks [/h1]
Hi everybody, 

This mod add api for adding alternatives to source item in recipes. Api is primarily for mod creators.
The main reason I created this api is because I found an item from one mod, but I couldn't use it in a recipe from another mod.
It is similar to https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=566115016&searchtext=item+tweaker but for recipes.
Mod was written in Typescript and compiled into Lua using PipeWrench and TypescriptToLua projects. 

[h2] Api for other modders !!![/h2] 

[h2] How to Use RecipeTweaks:[/h2] 
- make sure that recipeapi is near start of mod order. 
- code
[code] 
if getActivatedMods():contains("recipetweaks") then
    -- Import RecipeTweaks API
    local ____RecipeAPi = require("recipetweaks/api/RecipeAPi")

    -- Use the API functions to add tweaks to recipes
    -- (Example tweaks are provided in the code in example mod)
    local AddTweakAllRecipe = ____RecipeAPi.AddTweakAllRecipe
    local CreateRecipeSourceChanges = ____RecipeAPi.CreateRecipeSourceChanges
    
    -- Add your custom changes here
    -- Example: Add alternative item to all recipes with Base.Needle
    AddTweakAllRecipe(CreateRecipeSourceChanges("Base.Needle", { "Hydrocraft.HCBoneneedle" }))

    -- Example: Add Hydrocraft.HCTincan as an alternative to Base.TinCanEmpty
    AddTweakAllRecipe(CreateRecipeSourceChanges("Base.TinCanEmpty", { "Hydrocraft.HCTincan" }))

    -- Example: Reverse the alternative, adding Base.TinCanEmpty as an alternative to Hydrocraft.HCTincan
    AddTweakAllRecipe(CreateRecipeSourceChanges("Hydrocraft.HCTincan", { "Base.TinCanEmpty" }))
end
[/code]
